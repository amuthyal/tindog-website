This a basic website project to better understand bootstrap 4 <br>
you can view this website at https://amuthyal.github.io/tindog-website/index.html

<p> This Website has 6 sections namely </p>
<ol> <li> title </li>
  <li> features </li>  <li> testimonials </li> <li> press </li> <li> pricing </li> <li> cta </li> </ol> 

<p> I used  CSS Bootstrap 4 to build the nav-bar and to make it more responsive. </p>

<p> The Buttons in the title section are styled using CSS Bootstrap 4 </p>

<p> Added Bootstrap CDN instead of dowloading the source files and calling them. </p>

<p>  Used z-index property to place the bottom half of the mobile picture underneath the next section </p>

<p> Used https://fontawesome.com/ for the icons in the features section </p>

<p> Added Caraousel to the testimonial Section </p>

<p> Used card class for the pricing section </p>
